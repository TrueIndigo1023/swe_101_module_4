# SWE101: Programming Fundamentals

## Assessment 04 Javascript Fundamentals

### Case Background

Introducing Quantum Financial Solutions, a leading global finance and investment management firm, we specialize in offering bespoke solutions to a vast clientele, ranging from individual investors to large corporations. Our success is driven by our ability to swiftly adapt to the ever-changing dynamics of global financial markets and deliver precision-tailored investment strategies.

Recently, Quantum's 'Innovation & Strategy' division identified a trend. With the digitization of finance, clients increasingly prefer instantaneous and transparent insights into their investments. In response to this, Quantum aims to integrate advanced computational tools that can swiftly calculate, analyze, and provide insights on various investment portfolios.

However, the roadblock lies in the vast amount of intricate financial data which can often become overwhelming to process manually. In response, the company envisions a digital tool, a 'Financial Calculator', which automates the process. This tool would not only calculate returns on investments but also compare and derive insights, offering clients a snapshot of their financial health.

You, as a data analyst, have been handpicked for this project. With your acumen in data processing and manipulation, the challenge is to construct the backbone of this 'Financial Calculator'. Your script will be the heartbeat of this tool, driving precision, speed, and insight.

### Objective

In a world where data drives decisions, the onus lies on analysts to navigate the intricate financial webs and derive actionable insights. Your mission, as part of Quantum Financial Solutions, is clear yet challenging: craft a script, the underpinning of the 'Financial Calculator', a tool that epitomizes automation, accuracy, and agility. Dive deep into the realms of JavaScript to manipulate, process, and visualize financial data, enabling Quantum's clientele to glimpse their financial trajectory at the click of a button. This assignment tests your prowess in not just understanding financial data but molding it into discernible insights.

### Section 1: Setting Up JavaScript File (5 points)

#### Task 1.1

Create a new JavaScript file financialCalculator.js. (5 points)

### Section 2: Variables (10 points)

#### Task 2.1

Create three variables: principal, rate, and time. Assign an arbitrary number to each variable. (10 points)

### Section 3: Arithmetic Operators and Control Flow (15 points)

#### Task 3.1

Calculate the investment return using the formula A = P(1 + r)t. Store the final result in a new variable totalAmount. Log totalAmount to the console. (15 points)

### Section 4: Arrays and Spread Operator (20 points)

#### Task 4.1:

Create an array investments and assign it three arrays each with three elements - principal, rate, time. (10 points)

#### Task 4.2:

Create a function calculateInvestment which accepts three elements (P, r, t) and calculates the future investment amount using the same formula as above. Make sure this function uses the spread operator to accept the elements. (10 points)

### Section 5: Arrow Functions (20 points)

#### Task 5.1:

Use the map function to calculate the future value of all investments in the investments array. Store the result in a new variable futureValues. Log futureValues to the console. (20 points)

### Section 6: Comparison and Logical Operators (10 points)

#### Task 6.1:

Find the investment with the highest future value. Log the result to the console. (10 points)

### Section 7: Ternary Operators (20 points)

#### Task 7.1:

Use a ternary operator to check if all investments have a future value higher than a certain amount (e.g., $20000). Log the result to the console. (20 points)
